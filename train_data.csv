43,2019-08-29T01:31:19.124Z,,Kirollos N,False,False,False,False,STAR_4,"The Lion King is directed by Jon Favreau, the director of The Jungle Book 2016, screenplay by Jeff Nathanson and starring Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, Beyoncé Knowles and James Earl Jones once again as Mufasa.

The Lion King is Disney's 3rd Live-Action remake this year. And in case you haven't watched the original, the plot is about Simba, a lion prince, after his father's death takes an adventure, and during this adventure he finds out that there's more in life than what he expected.

The original Lion King movie is my favorite animated movie of all time, and it's in my top 3 movies of all time too, I think it's a masterpiece in every way possible, so I was super-excited to see how could they turn that masterpiece into a Live-Action remake, and I find it a little bit weird to call it ""Live-Action"", because technically, it's animated but in a very realistic way! We'll get to that point later.
I was also afraid, because The Lion King is so close to my heart, I grew up watching it, so I was afraid to see this movie fail or something, but fortunately it didn't!

The Lion King has an impressive visual effects, it never felt CGI-ed or anything, it was so real, the details were very impressive, I like that very much, because the original was richly drawn with amazing colors, it's the best 2D animated movie ever made, and it was revolutionary, so it's good to see the Live-Action remake revolutionary too! But as it was impressive and pleasant to the eyes, it was also emotionless! That's my biggese with this movie, that there's no emotion is this movie, every scene it's just lions moving their mouths and words coming out, or just animals doing stuff, you never get attached to them the same way you did in the original, because in the original you saw them smile, cry, laugh.. you saw their emotions, and that touched us so deep sometimes, but in this movie, it wasn't even near to the original.

The movie was also shot-by-shot a remake, for some that could be a huge problem, for me that all I wanted to see from this movie, I didn't expect anything more, though the movie adds 30 minutes, it didn't add enough to the story, it's just the plot of the original, and I'm okay with that, even the soundtrack was almost the same, same songs -only one new-, same OST by the same composer, so technically, they didn't do anything creative, or more than what they did back in 1994. It was all about nostalgia, to feel nostalgic to your childhood, and it did that perfectly, but there's no point to make this move, except for making somethings more clearer than the original, more animals talking, because that was weird to see only the main characters talking in the original, things that can make more sense than the original.. and money!

The casting choices are amazing, everyone made a great job, to see James Earl Jones back as Mufasa, it added something more to the movie, Donald Glover was amazing as Simba, JD McCrary as young Simba too.. Seth Rogen as Pumba was magnificent, unfortunately, there's a so little of him in that movie, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar was the MVP of this movie, though he wasn't that great as Jeremy Irons, but he was so good as a villain! Billy Eichner as Timon is the worst, he didn't add anything to his character, and he was so emotionless, he wasn't that funny, even though, Timon was the hilarious part of the original, but Billy Eichner didn't do it right!

The movie has 30 min more, and -as I said- they made added more sense sometimes, but sometimes they added scenes just to make it to almost 2 hours, and they even deleted some scenes of Rafiki, there were so little of him in this movie! The original has a great scene between Simba and Rafiki, and it's not in this one anymore.

The Lion King gave justice to the original, though it did lack of emotions, and added some unnecessary scenes, and deleted an important scene, some of the changes were welcome, some not very, but still it was very good to see a great Live-Action remake from Disney again!

I'm gonna give The Lion King an A-!

Key scenes are not alternated, but changed completely. The acting is so-so. You will notice the difference in personalities and characteristics of the characters. They had no attempts of trying to preserves the original nature of the classic characters. The staple of this movie is two things, it’s music and it’s drama. First, the singing was very difficult just to like, not even love. Second, the drama was completely taken out of the movie from the cinematic and animations to the voiceovers. The new dialogue wasn’t good and to top it off some character sound like they were reading off the script. It equaled a lifeless performance. The only thing in this movie that was honestly great was the instrumentals. I could continue further into my review, but I think the point is clear.

  Firstly, the voice acting. For the most part, the voice acting in the film sounds unnatural and like they were purely reading from a script.  Some of the highlighted talent in the film would have to be Seth Rogen (Pumba), Billy Eicher (Timon), and JD McCary (Young Simba) and the rest of the Hyena trio. James Earl Jones was okay but didn't surprise me at all with his performance. However, the voice of Scar, Chiwetel Ejiofor, is exceptionally good. 

  Secondly, the lack of emotions on pretty much every character. One of the many things that the animated '94 film got away with was the emotions. It was animated so biology never really played a factor. Due to the realism of the film, the dance sequences/songs, and many of the character development scenes felt flat and bland. While I enjoyed the dance sequences it just felt bland at the same time. Specifically the I Can't-Wait to be King scene fell far down due to realism.  I was seriously and mentally preparing myself for the death of Mufasa and sadly while it was still sad and the same besides one iconic shot being change, the entire sequence felt emotionless and nearly didn't affect as much as it did back in 1994. 

  In conclusion, I enjoyed The Lion King for what it was. It was a bland re-telling of the beloved classic. While I loved some changes added to Nala's character and the epic fight sequence, the film overall fell flat for me.

I was bored out of my mind. It's rant time:

😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it's animals in this movie.

😡However, I've got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.
.
1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that's the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. 

2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying ""Is that a challenge?!"". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.

1+2=3) With one and two combined, it's just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba's pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.

4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. 

What do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC's animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character's emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. 

The battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were ""protected"" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...

5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. 
Ok, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. 

The movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. 

Anyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.",2.0,5d ago,2019-08-27T18:38:44.923Z,/user/id/883901140,Xavier P,RT,883901140

Scar as a whole is terrible - they made an artistic choice to portray him as somewhat mangy and sickly looking, which does not make for an intimidating villain.  And his iconic ""Be Prepared"" sequence is only memorable for how flat and terrible it was.

My single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.

The significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact — scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. 

Upon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.
 
The film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.

It is directed by Jon Favreau, who previously directed Disney's The Jungle Book. It uses
the photorealistic computer-animation technique to create animals. The 1994's version is
one of the best movies of all time. So does this movie lives up to all hype? Definitely.
All animals look so realistic that you can't differentiate between them and those in
National Geographic's documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is
one of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to
show expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,
which will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological
authenticity.
It would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994's version as
childhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always
be better than the later one.
As an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their
bonding, Mufasa's philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can
easily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father's
paw, the scene is literally heart touching.
Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both
characters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy ""Hakuna Matata""
which was opposite of Mufasa's Philosophy.
There is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and
perfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.",4.0,"Aug 24, 2019",2019-08-24T13:31:42.221Z,/user/id/978207266,Mahendra C,RT,978207266

And then we had it on DVD and watched it a million more times. We know every word. The original was one of the best Disney movies ever, in my opinion. So, when we heard about the remake 25 years later we were excited and went to see it together again. The effects are nice, but they're not, because the characters lacked the heart and emotion and humor of the first film. It just wasn't the same at all. And Scar's character was completely different.

Pretty much a scene-by-scene replica of the original, which makes it palatable for all ages because the original was good, but also feels uninspired and ""cheap."" The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you've read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It's fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy ""Come-ons!"" and ""Let's do this!"" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce's character literally yells ""Lions, Attack!""  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala. It felt so wrong, out of place and obnoxious. All in all worth an end of summer family trip to the movie, but otherwise, you won't miss much by waiting for the DVD/BluRay.",3.5,"Aug 18, 2019",2019-08-18T20:19:47.794Z,/user/id/971578654,critical m,RT,971578654

The songs were either not trying at all (Be Prepared I'm looking at you) or mismatched vocalists (Can You Feel The Love Tonight) or mismatched visuals (I Just Can't Wait To Be King and Can You Feel The Love TONIGHT). 

What should have been a really powerful scene was almost comedic when when Scar asks Adult Simba who was to blame for Mufasa's death and Simba quickly mumbles ""it was me.""

I actually like it just as much as the original if not more. I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn’t necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau’s brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it’s not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn’t have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could’ve done with the scope of the task at hand.

From minute one, Lion King demonstrated the awesome master combination of Disney filmmaking technics far beyond Walt Disney graphics beginnings.

A scene or two later into the story, a mean aggressive hyena suddenly pops up from the shadows threatening our innocent heroes in the story. 
Unfortunately, the scene was shockingly racial. 
The audiovisual was too overt to escape my sensibilities. 
The hyena was black. Hyenas are generally tan or grey. Not black. You could blame it on the lighting but the hyena was black.

In fact, it appears that the mean hyena was crafted to emulate a black person. Furthermore, its voice over sounded like a black man. 

Of course the little children in the audience had no clue they were being brainwashed.

Lion King storyline attempted the proverbial Joseph Campbell mono-myth dramatic curve.  They even had the cleansing rain at the end but it was no help to improve the  distasteful bathroom humor.
Lion King failed to sustain the tit-for-tat excitement of Disney yesteryears movies.

The film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.

The story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.

The voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.

The characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.

The animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.

The colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.

The soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyoncé and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyoncé's song Spirit.

The emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.

The film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.

Over all I give it a 
1/10 - would never recommend

Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans.

The songs were so devoid of the original sass and personality from the original and visually, all the lions looked the same and expressionless. All the gorgeous colors and scenes from the original were desaturated and the life was sucked from them. The VAs have amazing voices but it felt like listening to a music video rather than a kid lion singing. I'd recommend the original or the musical, not this one.

If you got kids you want to introduce Disney films to, the classics are still where to go to.  I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.  On the minus column I think the CGI of the lions faces was subpar, really didn't feel any emotion there.  Zazu as well... hard to watch the way that bird was made, a bit freaky.
